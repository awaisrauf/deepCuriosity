Pakistan recently held its general elections and a new party's government has been elected. This newly elected government came with a reformist agenda and started implementing its reforms by making task forces and advisory councils consisting of renowned professionals, academics, and other stakeholders. One such advisory council was established for reforms in the country's deteriorating economy by Finance Minister Asad Umar having four economists from famous international universities. One of these academics is Atif Mian, who belongs to a minority group having historical issues with the Muslim majority. This picking created
 widespread criticism and the government had to take its decision back. This was very disappointing as a professional should be evaluated on his / her skills rather than religious affiliations. His resignation too provoked a storm and the internet was full of arguments from both sides. From the internet, it appeared like an action that could damage the reformist agenda of the party or a revolutionary step. Seeing this political mess, I decided to read some well-researched books to understand what makes countries fail in the long run and how this "resignation" can affect Pakistan. In this quest, I came across the book "Why Nations Fail" by two development economists from MIT and Harvard. In my very first blog, I will be presenting a review of the book and answers and the sense
 of relief I got from this book.

### Theory of Prosperity

<img src="https://awaisrauf.github.io/bookshelf/imgs/why_nations_fail.jpg" style="width:15%;">

This book presents a new theory to explain the reasons why some nations prosper while many others linger behind. The heart of the theory lies in two terms: inclusive and extractive institutions. Extractive institutions are those that do their best for the benefit of a narrow group of elites, exploiting national resources to benefit a few, and inclusive institutions work for the "many". Authors theorize that countries with more inclusive economic and political
 institutions tend to get prosperous while extractive economic and political institutes make countries fail. To force their argument of inclusive-extractive
 institutions, the authors start with an example of two neighboring towns at the Mexico-USA border and explain inequality between geographically and culturally similar
 towns and their relation with inclusive and extractive institutions by first explaining the historical roots of the system of both countries and then their present
 shape.

### Lessons from History

This book sees every historical event from the neolithic revolution, the Roman Empire's rise, and fall, the great Mayan civilization, European colonization,
 and the Glorious Revolution to the Industrial Revolution with a lens of inclusive-extractive institutions. Their theory suggests that sustainable growth is
 only possible if a country's system is pluralistic where the voice of many is heard and acted upon while countries with absolutist regimes tend to fail even if
 they got short-term success. One major example of this theory is how the British and the USA got so much prosperous while the Soviet Union, even after a short period
 of rapid growth fall behind. After Magna Carta in the thirteenth century, the power of the crown started to decline in Britain and parliament got more and
 more powerful. People started becoming more and more invested in the political process. This forced parliament to start listing to people making political
 institutions more and more plural. On the other hand, the Soviets were under an absolutist regime where individuals had no say in the political process. This
 made political and then economic institutions more and more extractive and thus stopping short-lived progress.

Another important aspect of this theory is the critical juncture: a defining moment in history that presents a chance for nations to change everything for the better
such as the Black Death or glorious revolution in Great Britain, the French Revolution, the civil war in the USA, independence for European colonies, etc. Authors argue that
 little improvements towards inclusiveness play a major role at the time of critical juncture. For instance, since there was some inclusiveness in Britain's
 institutions at the time of the Glorious Revolution, a critical juncture, it made it possible for parliamentary forces to win and a slow democratic process started
 similarly Australia and USA got benefited from Industrial Revolution, another critical juncture, due to inclusive nature of their institutions who supported
 new technology. Many African and Asian countries were unable to reap the benefits of the industrial revolution or independence due to the lack of these
 institutions and fear of creative destruction from elites.

Authors then describe vicious and virtuous cycles of extractive and inclusive institutions i.e. extractive institutions reinforce the path for even more extractive
 institutions that tend to be long-term while a virtuous cycle is exactly the inverse of it. While all these factors do play an important role, there is another
 contingent part of history. Take the example of the black death that shock the foundations of feudalism and serfdom in Britain when peasants started movements to get
 rid of them. On the other hand, similar efforts of serfs failed in many Eastern European countries after the same black death.

The book presents a lot of historical events from around the globe from the Neolithic revolution to as recent as 2010's Arab Spring revolution and discusses it
 from the perspective of their theory of why nations fail. Though the book is lengthy having 460+ pages, it presents a very sane argument with a strong
 historical background, and it's worth a read. I would rate it 4.5 out of 5. It's a must-read for people interested in politics and how little things
 have larger effects in the long run.

### Answers to my questions

Lastly, I got a wave of relief after reading this book in times of such political polarity. I think more and more people should be getting involved
 in the political process and making it harder for government to do wrong. A government that responds to criticism of people is better in the long run as it tends to represent the common good. No matter how slow, democracy is the only true and long-term solution. Therefore, we should support pluralistic politics and stronger, inclusive institutions.
