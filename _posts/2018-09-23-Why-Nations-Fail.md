Pakistan recently held its general elections and a new party's government has been elected. This newly elected government came with a reformist agenda and
 started implementing it reforms by making task forces and advisory councils consisting of renown professionals, academics and other stakeholders. One such
 advisory council was established for reforms in country's deteriorating economy by finance minister Asad Umar having four economists from famous international
 universities. One of these academics was Atif Mian who belongs to a minority group having historical issues with the Muslim majority. This selection created
 widespread criticism and government had to take its decision back. This was very disappointing as a professional should be evaluated on his/her skills rather
 than his/her religious affiliation. His resignation too provoked a storm and the internet was full of argument form both sides. From the internet, it appeared
 like an action that could damage the reformist agenda of the party or a revolutionary step. Seeing this political mess, I decided to read some well-researched
 book to understand what really makes countries fail in the long run and how this "resignation" can affect Pakistan. In this quest, I came across this book 
 "Why Nations Fail" by two development economists from MIT and Harvard. In my very first blog, I will be presenting a review of the book and answers and sense
 of relief I got from this book.


### Theory of Prosperity 
<img src="https://awaisrauf.github.io/bookshelf/imgs/why_nations_fail.jpg" style="width:15%;">

This books basically presents a new theory to explain the reasons why some nations prosper while many other linger behind. Heart of the theory lies in two
 terms: inclusive and extractive institutions. Extractive institutions are those who do their best for the benefits of a narrow group of elites, exploiting
 national resources to benefit a few and inclusive institutions work for the "many". Authors theorize that countries with more inclusive economic and political
 institutions tend to get prosperous while extractive economic and political institutes make countries fail. To force their argument of inclusive-extractive
 institutions, authors start with an example of two neighboring towns at Mexico-USA border and explain inequality between geographically and culturally similar
 towns and its relation with inclusive and extractive institutions by first explaining historical roots of the system of both countries and then their present
 shape.


### Lessons from History
This book sees every historical event from the neolithic revolution, the Roman Empire's rise, and fall, great Mayan civilization, European colonization,
 the Glorious Revolution to Industrial revolution with a lens of inclusive-extractive institutions. Their theory suggests that a sustainable growth is
 only possible if country's system is pluralistic where voice of many is heard and acted upon while countries with absolutist regime tend to fail even if
 they got short-term success. One major example of this theory is how British and USA got so much prosperous while the Soviet Union, even after a short period
 of rapid growth fall behind. After Magna Carta in the thirteenth century, the power of the crown started to decline in Britain and parliament got more and
 more powerful. People started becoming more and more invested in the political process. This forced parliament to start listing to people making political
 institutions more and more plural. On the other hand, Soviets were under an absolutist regime where individuals had no say in the political process. This
 made political and then economic institutions more and more extractive and thus stopping short lived progress.


Another important aspect of this theory is critical juncture: a defining moment in history which presents a chance for nations to change everything for better
 such as Black death or glorious revolution in Great Britain, French revolution, civil war in USA, independence for European colonies etc. Authors argue that
 little improvements towards inclusiveness play a major role at the time of critical juncture. For instance, since there was some inclusiveness in Britain's
 institutions at the time of Glorious Revolution, a critical juncture, it made it possible for parliamentary forces to win and a slow democratic process started
 similarly Australia and USA got benefited from Industrial Revolution, another critical juncture, due to inclusive nature of their institutions who supported
 new technology. Many African and Asian countries were unable to reap the benefits of industrial revolution or independence due to the lack of these
 institutions and fear of creative destruction from elites.


Authors then describe vicious and virtuous cycles of extractive and inclusive institutions i.e. extractive institutions reinforces path for even more extractive
 institutions that tend to be long-term while a virtuous cycle is exactly inverse of it. While all these factors do play an important rule, there is another
 contingent part of history. Take the example of black death that shock foundations of feudalism and serfdom in Britain when peasants started movements to get
 rid of them. On the other hand, similar efforts of serfs failed in many eastern European countries after the same black death.

Book presents a lot of historical events from around the globe from the neolithic revolution to as recent as 2010's Arab spring revolution and discusses it
 from the perspective of their theory of why nations fail. Though the book is lengthy having 460+ pages, it presents a very sane argument with a strong 
 historical background and its worth a read. I would rate it 4.5 out of 5. Its definitely a must read for people interested in politics and how little things
 have larger effect in the long run.

### Answers to my questions

Lastly, I got a wave of relief after reading this book in times of such political polarity. I think it is better that more and more people are getting involved
 in the political process and making it harder for government to do wrong. A government that responds to criticism of people is better in the long run as it
 tends to represent common good. No matter how slow, democracy is only true and long-term solution. Therefore, we should support pluralistic politics and
 stronger, inclusive institutions.
