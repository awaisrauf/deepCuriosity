Lahore is known for its literary circles. India Tea House was a major hub for intellectuals especially for left-leaning, progressives of the subcontinent. After partition, India Tea House became Pak Tea House yet it keeps on embracing progressives. However, in the last two or three decades, much of it has changed. Pak Tea House got closed in 2000 and progressives disappeared. 


Afkar-e-Taza (new thoughts) ThinkFest seems to be an effort to bring this environment back. It is a two-day
the event, held by Information Technology University's Center of Governance and Policy (CGP) every year. Yaqoob Bangish, a 
prominent historian, writer and faculty member of ITU is its major architect and steward. Thinkers, historians, journalists, 
academics, and intellectuals from around the globe and especially from the subcontinent attend it and discuss issues that impact this region. This year's ThinkFest was the second successful episode arranged at the famous Alhamra Art Council alongside historical mall road. The event consists of a lot of panel discussions, books fare and food festivals. Fortunately, I was able to attend this year's ThinkFest. In this blog, I will try to write insightful discussions and arguments that took my heart during this festival.

### First Day

The first panel discussion was on the future of democracy in Pakistan, hosted by Najam Sethi. The role of establishment and declining democratic tradition in Pakistan was discussed. Several concerns on democratic norms and the role of the military establishment were raised. One interesting point on which both participants agreed on was: the military now understands that a coup is not an option now. They also discussed limiting the role of establishment and to strengthen democracy. While I agreed with the panel on limiting the role of the military in politics and the democratic process, I disagree on their approach. The beauty of democracy is its evolutionary process. A revolutionary wipeout of major stakeholders such as military establishment is not possible in the democratic process. Instead of heedlessly following this goal, we should focus on a gradual limitation of non-democratic forces. We can learn lessons from the birthplace of democracy, the United Kingdom, where powerful monarchy and parliament co-existed for long periods eventually paving the way for a democratic society. 

Another point on which I disagreed was that political parties tend to be corrupt so it shouldn't be a major concern. Guests gave the example of India where a lot of parliamentarians have corruption and criminal charges. Unfortunately, we are very different from India in the sense that we have a strong military which thinks of itself as a savior of Pakistan. The major excuse for all the military coups was corruption so we should not ignore this point. The best way to limit non-democratic forces in Pakistan is by having a good political party.

The second panel discussion was on the Kartarpur border opening and future of Punjab. This discussion was in Punjabi and made me nostalgic. First time in my life, I had seen left-leaning Punjabi intellectuals. Their discussion gave me the realization that I had never been exposed to Punjabi literature and there is a serious gap. From the last few years, I have felt that Punjabi culture and language attracts me. I have seen movies on pre-partition Punjabi culture and have listened to folksongs thanks to coke-studio. These are only two mediums available as Punjabi literature is almost non-existent in Pakistan.

The panel discussion on the history of Punjab was interesting. They demystified the myth of Punjab always bowing down to foreign invaders. They also discussed the role of Britishers in breaking of Punjabi culture and norms to get access into Afghanistan and neighboring regions. Britishers banned Punjabi and made Urdu as lingua franca. They made propaganda literature on previous Punjabi rulers and started communal problems among Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs. After partition, Punjab was divided first into Indian and Pakistani Punjab and then even more divisions after partition in both Indian and Pakistani Punjab. Original Punjab consisted of Kashmir, some areas of KPK, Sindh and three provinces of India. They gave valid arguments against the recent suggestion of the division of Pakistani Punjab into two parts. Speakers argued that we should exclude religion from Kartarpur and should focus on Punjab debate. Unfortunately, some racist remarks were also made by the guests which made the event a bit bad.



I was late in the third-panel discussion on foreign policy but I was able to discuss with panelist Moueed Yousaf, a prominent academic, journalist, and foreign policy expert. I asked him a question that always intrigues me: "Why the USA invade countries?". I can understand the motives of the British Kingdom but US invasions are different. Cold war era madness or invasion of Afghanistan can be understood based on war hysteria and fear of Al-Qaida. But what about the invasion of Iraq, Syria, and Libya? There is no profit motive as all invasion was very costly. Democracy rhetoric can also be refuted based on the Iraq and Afghanistan experience. He made the argument that countries do make blunders. It is easy for us to look back and see mistakes but very difficult to predict at the time. He also suggested Israel's hand as these three states were the prime threat to the country's existence.

Another interesting and long discussion was with veteran journalist and writer Murtaza Solangi. He was disappointed with major political parties such as PPPP and PMLN. PPPP, according to him, is a party of money lenders and elites and PMLN is the voice of the business community. This has created a political black hole as there is no voice for the middle and lower class. He told me that PMLN is full of people who want to join echelons of power even if they had to break a deal with the establishment. I asked him about the future role of PTM and how we need likes of PTM to limit non-democratic powers instead of corrupt political parties. He agreed with me on PTM's role but was a very skeptic of any major role of such small "movement".

One question, I always had in my mind is about the camps of journalists. It seems like the journalist in Pakistan don't just support democracy but rather they tend to be in camps, anti or pro-establishment. His answers were not that convincing.  



The next session was on the Past and Future of Afghanistan. One of the guests was a grandchild of British ambassador at Afghanistan at the time of partition of the subcontinent. Her book on the British era Afghanistan, The End Game, documents Afghanistan of the time and its relationship with Pakistan. She told the origins of the Pak-Afghan conflict and how Pakistan's failed policy made things worse at the time of independence. Interesting views were presented by Afrasiab Khatak, ex ANP senator and a prominent Pashtoon leader from KPK. He warned about the possible Taliban govt in Afghanistan that could be dangerous for Pakistan as well, as it can make the Pakistani Taliban stronger. He discussed how strong cultural ties between the two countries can be used to make relationships better for both countries. He suggested that there is a change of mindset in the Pakistani establishment. The third guest was a security analyst from the UK. He revealed some interesting facts about the Taliban and suggested that the USA does not feel any threat from the Taliban but China and other regional powers may not feel comfortable with them.

After the session, I had a brief discussion with Afrasiab Khatak. I am very curious about PTM, a movement started by some intelligent and well-read Pashtoon people against the oppression in FATA. I asked him about ANP's future and what is the future of leftist politics in the Pashtoon belt. PTM, according to him, is a result of ANP's failure for becoming the voice of oppressed people of FATA.

The last and most interesting discussion was about the upcoming Indian election how they can affect the peace process started by Pakistan. One of the guests was Khursheed Qusori, former foreign minister and architect of 6 point peace formula that almost solved the Kashmir issue in 2006-07. He discussed his efforts for peace and excitement on both sides when he suggested a peace formula. He revealed some interesting things about the Mumbai attacks and how the US defused flames of war between the two countries.

This discussion was also joined by an Indian academic who is an acclaimed critic of Indian policies in Kashmir. His views on Kashmir and the peace process were different. He argued that the only way to achieve peace is by stopping human rights violations on both sides of the border. He also claimed that people in India have fed up by Modi and its likely that he will not be next PM even if BJP wins. He told us that Pakistan is not that much of an issue in these elections and the economy will likely decide the fate of the election.

### Second Day

The second day was even more energetic and full of intellectual energy. The first panel discussion was on why media failed by Raza Rumi and [Nermeen Shiekh](https://twitter.com/nermeendn). Raza Rumi's argument on media being central Punjab and Karachi centric due to the audience was interesting. He also discussed current levels of censorship on media and how ad revenue is being used to censor the media. I asked him the same question from the last day: "Why media tend to join camps?". He told me that this was started by the establishment where they would arm-twist the media to get results. This persuaded other parties like PMLN to buy media for their purposes.

My interaction with Nermeen Shiekh from Democracy Now was also intriguing. The main point of her discussion was how people tend not to share stories of violence by acquaintances and how it impacts society. She gave several examples from her family as of how she came to know horror stories about her grandparents much later in life. This example reminded me of my grandparents especially my dada who used to told us stories of partition and how life was difficult after it. To my surprise, he never expressed these stories with my father. She also discussed how Germany's brutal behavior in the second world war was forgotten for a long time.

The second panel discussion was about LOC and Pak-India relationships. It was an academic talk with an overview of an interesting book written by one of the guests, Dr. Happy. His thesis about ceasefire violations at the Pak-India border also known as LOC and its dynamics was insightful. Contrary to the popular belief in India and Pakistan, he revealed that there are so many "local" factors involved such that it is almost impossible for a center to control it. He also shared how ceasefire violations cause human suffering on both sides of the border and how it is almost out of the equation for policymakers. 

The third talk was the most overrated but high profile due to its guests and controversial topic. Fahad Ch, Information Minister along with two journalists Fahad Hussain and Owais Toheed was discussing why media should change its model. Fawad Ch.'s argument "media's old model to keep on producing talk shows to make narratives while getting money from govt is outdated" was quite valid. But so was opponent's blame of how govt is using ad money to censor media. Fahad Hussain, a famous journalist, discussed some very sane, neutral and insightful points. He told about the decline of old school media and the emergence of new types of media in the world. He also talked about censorship and how media itself is part of it.

The last and most interesting panel discussion that I have attended was with Prof. Akeel Bilgarami. He was talking about secularism and identity. He discussed how some scholars think of secularism as Christianity of the 21st century. This argument is very interesting and requires an understanding of history to grasp it. Another interesting thing was his brief definition of secularism based upon three simple principles: religious freedom, giving fundamental rights and if there is a contradiction or conflict between the first two, prioritize second. This definition was simple but thought-provoking. He also diffused the myth of difference between the secularism of India and Europe by describing that secularism is purely a European product. This talk was one of the very interesting, full of intellectual energy and thought-provoking.

Fortunately, I was also able to meet and discuss a few things with a veteran journalist and analyst Musharraf Zaidi. He is the founder of very efficient and useful NGO Alif Ailan which releases education ranking of schools. This NGO was closed recently. I asked him the reason for closing such a great avenue. He told me that the purpose of Alif Ailan was to give policymakers a push to start. The purpose was completed so they closed it. He shared how bureaucracy and old system impedes for govt to start such work. I also asked him about the school level ranking that I thought of while working with a project. He was skeptical about the availability of the data thought he was interested in the idea. He was very skeptic about the progress of AI in Pakistan. He also advised me to stop listening to the news and focus on research. He seemed to be the most reasonable person in the entire thinkFest.

### Final Thoughts
Apart from some very interesting, intellectual discussions, ThinkFest was littered with a fight that is also being played out in echelons of power. Democracy and media censorship was two prominent topics. I am a very strong believer in democracy and the limited power of non-democratic forces such as the army. But I got amazed when I saw elite class, media, and politicians shouting for democracy while doing everything they can to undermine it. This needed to be changed. If the media and our elite class are interested in democracy, they need to employ a bottom-up approach. Democracy would never have been as successful if it was not for the industrial revolution which promoted the education of masses and then revolutionized society by the introduction of science. Our media needed to partially abandon its breaking and sensational news model and need to air serious shows with the discussion on broader issues that require public attention. It needed to educate society and introduce science to it. Our politicians needed to show the effectiveness of the Government of the people, by the people, for the people. Artificial intelligence is being dubbed as a 4th industrial revolution with the potential to change the world as we know it. We are standing at a critical moment. Our media should focus on it so that we can use it as Europe used first and second while the US, China, and Japan have used the third industrial revolution to strength their democracies. And our elite should form pressure groups to force the state, media, and politicians to use this opportunity.
